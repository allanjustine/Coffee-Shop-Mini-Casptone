                <p>Coffee Project’s signature blend is composed of 70% Arabica coffee that is imported from Brazil and 30%
                    Robusta coffee from Sumatra. This combination gives you coffee that is very flavorful and aromatic with
                    chocolaty and fruity notes. Many are also hooked with their best-selling drink, the Vietnamese Latte. It
                    is made from Nguyen beans from Vietnam. These beans have rich and strong flavor that blends beautifully
                    with sweetened milk giving you a rich and flavorful coffee with hints of chocolaty tones. To pair with
                    these delicious beverages, Coffee Project also serves variety of sandwiches, pasta and rice meals. Two
                    of the most promising dishes are the Sardine Pasta and the Beef Tapa.</p>
